# node_console_ask
A Node.js module for asking questions and receiving an array of answers via a Promise object.

The module incorporates Node's `readline.createInterface()` to coordinate a sequence of console based questions and recording their respective answers in an accessible array.

The file `demo.js` under the demo folder provides a demo using the module.  To run the demo:

1. Install the node_console_ask dependency. Enter the following in the terminal: 

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the Node.js application. Enter the following:

   ```
   node demo.js
   ```

   

The application will ask three questions and respond with an array of answers.
